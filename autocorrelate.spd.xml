  <description>Frequency domain implemenation of a windowed autocorrelation algorithim.  This algorthim works by windowing the input data to break it up into separate frames.  Each frame is independently autocorrelated with each other using a &quot;full&quot; autocorrelation which includes the full transient response.  This is efficiently computed in the frequency domain.</description>
