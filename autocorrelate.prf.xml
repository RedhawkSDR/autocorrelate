    <description>NORMAL is the standard autocorrelation layout where the center spike is in the middle of the output frame and you have 2*correlationSize+1 points

ROTATED flips the front and back of the display.  This puts the center spike at index 0 and frame index corresponds exactly to the delay.  This makes it easy to measure the correlation delay.  There are still 2*correlationSize+1 points per output frame.

SUPERIMPOSED is like ROTATED but the 2nd half of the output frame is flipped and added to the first half.  This means the output frame consists of exactly correlationSize output samples.  Autocorrelation will be approximately symmetric for indicies close to 0 since the correlation output for a delay of N is approximately the same as an advance of N for small N.  The superposition adds the correlation output for the delay as well as the advace to get twice the averaging effect.</description>
